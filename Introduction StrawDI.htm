<p>This page is the official website of the Strawberry Digital Images 
(StrawDI) data set, which contains 8000 images of strawberries, taken 
from 20 plantations, within an approximate area of 150 hectares, in the 
province of Huelva, Spain. The plantations were not changed in any way 
for the experiment and the images were taken from real production 
conditions during a full picking campaign (from mid-December 2018 to 
early May 2019).</p>

<p>The capture device used was a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge smartphone 
attached to an extendable arm. In order to build a data set close to the
 target application, the images were taken under different conditions of
 brightness, at a distance of approximately 20 cm from the ridge, at 
about 35 +-10 cm height and an approximate angle of 25 +-10º. The images
 have a 4032x3024 resolution and are stored in a JPEG format.</p>

<h2 id="strawdi_db1">StrawDI_Db1</h2>
<p>From the total set of images that make up the StrawDI data set, 3100 
images have been selected at random. For each of these images a ground 
truth labelled image has been manually generated containing the 
individual segmentation of all the strawberries appearing in the image.</p>

<p>To reduce the computational demands on the models, the images have 
been rescaled to 1008 x 756 and stored in PNG format. This set of images
 constitutes the <strong>StrawDI_Db1</strong> database. This database is divided into train (2800 images), validation (100 images) and test (200 images) subsets.</p>

<h3 id="labeling-policy">Labeling Policy</h3>
<p>The image labelling process has been validated by three blind reviews
 of the data with four reviewers, thus guaranteeing the quality of the 
segmentations. The criterion followed in the labelling process consists 
of creating as accurate a mask as possible for each of the strawberries 
appearing in the image, including extreme cases such as strawberries 
that are almost imperceptible due to distance, occlusions, being at the 
edges of the image or still unripe.</p>

<p>The ground truth images are grayscale images that are the same size 
as the original rgb images and they are stored in PNG format. In the 
ground truth images, the value 0 is used for non-strawberry pixels, and 
strawberry pixels have the index of their strawberry, from 1 to the 
number of strawberries in the image.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Below are examples of our high quality pixel annotations. Overlayed colors encode individual instances of strawberries.</p>
